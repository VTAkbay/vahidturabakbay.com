Hi,

I am **Turab** and 22 years old.

For the past almost 2 years, I have been worked as a **Full Stack Web & Web3 developer**.

I have background in **web3** development, with certificate from University at Buffalo Online through Coursera.org. What really got me into the field, though, is the certificates I got from Coursera.

Throughout my career, I can say absolutely that I have always that I learn **fast** and do **regular** work. Specially with good teammates.

Moving forward, I hope to expand my experience with different projects.
