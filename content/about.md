Hi,

I am **Turab**, a highly motivated and experienced **Full Stack Web3 developer with a strong background in Computer Science**. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of The People Online, where I am gaining a deeper understanding of the latest technologies and trends in the field.

For the past two years, I have been working as a Full Stack Web3 developer, utilizing my skills and knowledge to deliver high-quality projects for clients. I have **completed a certificate program** from the University at Buffalo Online through Coursera.org, which has provided me with a solid foundation in web3 development. Additionally, I have received certificates from Coursera that have further enhanced my skills in the field.

Throughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to learn quickly, adapt to new technologies and consistently perform well on projects. I am eager to continue expanding my experience with a variety of projects and stay at the forefront of the **Web3** development field.
